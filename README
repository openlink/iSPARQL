iSPARQL

Copyright (C) 2005-2017 OpenLink Software 

OpenLink iSPARQL is a utility for building and executing SPARQL
queries. 

It may be used on any standard SPARQL endpoint but can utilize the
full power of Virtuoso Sponger when connected to a Virtuoso endpoint.

The queries, together with various parameters may be saved in a
WebDAV-capable file server.
